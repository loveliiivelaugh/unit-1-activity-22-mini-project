# Unit 1 Activity 22 Mini Project

## Description

My motivation for this website was to replicate the look and functionality exactly like an assigned mock-up. I used HTML and CSS to build this web page and used the color dropper tool from Adobe Illustrator to extract the color values from the original image of the mock up.
